Hi, I am Sofia! I am currently in my third year of a Bachelor of Education (Secondary) with a major in Food Technology and a minor in Textiles. My passion lies in all things food; cooking, nutrition, food trends, and educating young people about the vital role food plays in our lives. I’m deeply committed to helping students develop practical skills and an understanding of how to make informed food choices that support a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
Outside of my studies, I enjoy baking and often spend my free time creating custom cakes, which allows me to explore creativity and refine my technical skills. My enthusiasm for food extends beyond the kitchen. I believe that teaching Food Technology is an opportunity to empower students with lifelong skills in health, sustainability, and wellbeing. As a future educator, I aim to foster engaging, inclusive, and hands-on learning experiences that inspire students to make positive choices and find joy in learning.

</body>
My teaching philosophy is built on the belief that every student deserves to feel inspired, supported, and valued. I strive to create an inclusive and equitable learning environment where students’ voices are heard and respected. By encouraging curiosity, collaboration, and critical thinking, I aim to empower students to engage deeply with their learning and develop the confidence to succeed both inside and outside the classroom.

</body>
I'm a soon to be TAS teacher who loves working with kids and helping them grow. I run a small cake business that brings my love for baking and creativity to life. Outside of this, I enjoy experimenting with healthy recipes, exploring how different foods and nutrients can nourish the body. I also work in before and after school care, which has deepened my passion for supporting and inspiring young people.
