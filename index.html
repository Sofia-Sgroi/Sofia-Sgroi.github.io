I am currently in my third year of a Bachelor of Education (Secondary) with a major in Food Technology and a minor in Textiles. My passion lies in all things food; cooking, nutrition, food trends, and educating young people about the vital role food plays in our lives. Iâ€™m deeply committed to helping students develop practical skills and an understanding of how to make informed food choices that support a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
Outside of my studies, I enjoy baking and often spend my free time creating custom cakes, which allows me to explore creativity and refine my technical skills. My enthusiasm for food extends beyond the kitchen. I believe that teaching Food Technology is an opportunity to empower students with lifelong skills in health, sustainability, and wellbeing. As a future educator, I aim to foster engaging, inclusive, and hands-on learning experiences that inspire students to make positive choices and find joy in learning.
