During this course, I have completed a variety of projects across different units, allowing me to develop and demonstrate my skills in both practical and creative contexts. Below, I have displayed two examples of my work: a Food Technology food product, which highlights my ability to design and create nutritious and appealing recipes, and a Textiles product, which showcases my creativity, technical skills, and attention to detail in design and construction.

For this project, I completed a decompose and redesign task where I selected a food product that could be improved. I chose the Serious Cookies gluten-free and vegan cookies and recreated them with significant enhancements. My improved version was moister, larger, more visually appealing, and offered better nutritional value while still being inclusive and enjoyable.

For my Textiles projects, I created two quilts: an art quilt and a community quilt. Both were inspired by the fashion brand Sabo Skirt, drawing on their beach-inspired aesthetic. Throughout these projects, I explored a range of sewing methods and further developed my quilting techniques, allowing me to enhance both the creative design and technical construction of my work.
